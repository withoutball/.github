#### Capabilities

- **Pose Estimation** — Multi-player skeletal pose inference at 25 fps, 17 keypoints per player
- **Movement Signatures** — Compact embeddings for off-ball behavior across leagues and seasons
- **Tactical Fingerprinting** — Automatic characterization of playing styles, formations, and transitions
- **Movement Search** — Query tactical events across entire seasons with zero manual tagging
- **Injury Risk Signals** — Detect biomechanical drift weeks before clinical symptoms appear
- **Predictive Runs** — Short-horizon probabilistic forecasts that surface runs and pressing triggers

#### Technology
